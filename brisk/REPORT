Also, it occurs to me that you don't say enough about the experimental innovations, e.g.,
parameter tuning procedure, when you introduce your thesis. - DONE

It is a good idea to begin the thesis by informing the reader of where your novel pieces are to be found (and in the
style of good essays - state what you are going to talk about, say it, recap what you
have just said). - DONE

At a high level, it looks fine. Feel free to submit when you are happy. When I read the
final version, I'll spend time going through all of the experimental details!

Cheers,
Ram

To add to report

To Do:

1. Emphasize that speed is crucial since the robot must match as many frames as are possible when on the field. It receives 30 frames perform
second and therefore must try and process one frame every 33 ms. This will allow the robot to match images faster utilising every possible
frame in order to find an image match

2. The overall time is not very relevant for the rUNSWift team since they use different image processing techniques on the robot.

3. Do I change BRISK0 to SBRISK - DONE

**********************************************************************************************
Keywords: field robotics
Tell a story
Emphasize that localisation is important for all types of robots. 
However, many types of robots are constrained for processing power and are therefore cannot run the best algorithm
since they arent able to feasibly work in real time.

I can state that I have utilised a method called BRISK0 - U-BRISK in order to enable robots with constrained processing power to
detect features.
- Here I will discuss the fact that time was crucial and therefore BRISK became BRISK0 and BRISK became U-BRISK
- Once this was achieved, the optimal parameters had to be found and this was performed through the development of
a novel matching function.
- It is important that valid matches are found using this method and in order to prevent matches from being rejected,
an angle and distance constraint has been developed in addition to the 2-NN ratio constraint
- Using this method, it was tested using images captured from the Nao's upper camera. 
- This was tested in a number of environments and it was found that it achieved good matching performance.
- This was compared with the 1D SURF method developed by the rUNSWift robocup team and it was foud that my method 
had better generalisation performance whereas their method was faster
- This was then tested outside since localisation cannot be constrained to indoor environments and achieved relatively good 
performance.
- This implies that it could be used on processing constrained systems for street navigation

Why is MPS better than CPS?

1. Gives slightly better performance overall.
2. Even though MPS gives slightly better performance, CPS is less prone to outliers than MPS since it finds the most consistent values.
3. However, MPS has a lower radius which means it will reject more potentially invalid matches

***********************ANALYSIS**********************************
Answer in the following order for each technique:
1. 2-NN
2. Radius Matching

Num interest points
AUC
Time
Reasons for problems:
1. Number FP matches detected
2. Matching Score Ratio

3. Number of matches detected
4. The number of valid matches



For the Main Robocup Dataset:
There are more matches in the Main Robocup dataset than in the other two datasets for these methods:
Methods:
1. BRISK0
2. BRISK4

Radius Matching:
1. Total Num Matches
2. Total Num Valid Matches

why not U-BRISK or 2D SURF create the same stats??
- Not that many interest points are detected by BRISK0, BRISK4, but many matches result.
- Could suggest a noisy environment, since there are more matches for each interest point

- Definitely Fluoresent lights are causing multiple matches. This is causing interest points to have multiple matches.

- This may not be the case for U-BRISK since due to the lack of rotation, it is not rotation invariant and therefore won't detect as many points

- BRISK0 is rotation invariant and therefore has the same problem as BRISK4.

- SURF2D uses the intensity information surrounding the interest point to describe the interest point. Thus descriptors are built based

on this information. It is possible that this distinguishes the interest point better than simple brightness comparison tests that are 
present in BRISK0

BRISK0-SURF2D:
1. Might not be set at an optimal threshold, therefore doesnt detect many matches


BRISK4:

1. Performs a non-maximal suppression along scale space which results in less interest points being detected
2. But more interest points may be detected as there are more octaves and therefore more ways to test interest points

3. Since BRISK4 has such a strong non-maximal suppression  criterion, it detects a large number of zero matches. This causes
the ROC curve to have a lower value than the other ROC curves.
4. In addition, BRISK4 has a large number of valid matches (these are duplicate matches that are matched with the fluorescent lights)
There are many strong edges and therefore these will go through the BRISK4's non-maximal suppression criterion.

BRISK0:
1. BRISK0 has less matches since less interest points are detected and therefore less valid matches are realised. However, the strong edges
will still get through these valid matches

U-BRISK:
1. U-BRISK is rotation variant and therefore many matches are lost due to this constraint. This actually aids the algorithm in removing
duplicate matches.
2. UBRISK - Does not perform a rotation and therefore less matches may be found


U-BRISK Lighting:
1. Many interest points found around wires and near the main lights.
2. It is possible that stronger edges are created due to the main light being on near the wires and this causes the large number of interest
points to be detected



SURF2D:

1.SURF2D has fewer matches



 - Reflections cause invalid matches. Remember to use the reflections from the window in the Main Robocup dataset
