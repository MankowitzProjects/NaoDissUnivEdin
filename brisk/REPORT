1. 2-NN criterion is only applied to 2-NN matching MATCHING

2. All the feature extraction algorithms operate at different thresholds EX

3. Each interest point can have more than one match in radius matching MATCHING

4. Only the best matching score is used as the threshold when creating the ROC Curves EX

5. Ceiling Features mentioned where the Nao Robocup Methods are mentioned
02/08/12

1. The interest point properties have been calculated using the MPS parameter setting EX
2. 2-NN Ratio was also calculated using the MPS parameter setting EX
 - The matching statistics and keypoints have been generated using the MPS parameter setting EX



3. Fix up discussion of the matching score EX
4. Motivate why I chose alpha and beta (I.e. their values) EX
5. Discuss that I could have found the Median value rather than averaging the maximum values EX

6. At the beginning of the optimal parameters section, state how the score is used to find the optimal detection parameters EX
And then the optimal paramters are used as a basis for comparison for each of the feature extraction algorithms

7. Emphasize that cannot test on training data and therefore generated a new completely unseen dataset EX
8. How did I find the visual overlap? (Justify using eyeball) EX

9. Strong edges are preserved when there is strong light. These edges have very similar neighborhood intensities. Causes duplicate matches EX


TO FIX:

1. Redo varying lighting conditions - DONE
2. Redo Nikon-camera Nao in Main Robocup dataset (new dataset) - DONE

5. Add a statistic that calculates the number of zero matches.

Why is MPS better than CPS?

1. Gives slightly better performance overall.
2. Even though MPS gives slightly better performance, CPS is less prone to outliers than MPS since it finds the most consistent values.
3. However, MPS has a lower radius which means it will reject more potentially invalid matches

***********************ANALYSIS**********************************
Answer in the following order for each technique:
1. 2-NN
2. Radius Matching

Num interest points
AUC
Time
Reasons for problems:
1. Number FP matches detected
2. Matching Score Ratio

3. Number of matches detected
4. The number of valid matches



For the Main Robocup Dataset:
There are more matches in the Main Robocup dataset than in the other two datasets for these methods:
Methods:
1. BRISK0
2. BRISK4

Radius Matching:
1. Total Num Matches
2. Total Num Valid Matches

why not U-BRISK or 2D SURF create the same stats??
- Not that many interest points are detected by BRISK0, BRISK4, but many matches result.
- Could suggest a noisy environment, since there are more matches for each interest point

- Definitely Fluoresent lights are causing multiple matches. This is causing interest points to have multiple matches.

- This may not be the case for U-BRISK since due to the lack of rotation, it is not rotation invariant and therefore won't detect as many points

- BRISK0 is rotation invariant and therefore has the same problem as BRISK4.

- SURF2D uses the intensity information surrounding the interest point to describe the interest point. Thus descriptors are built based

on this information. It is possible that this distinguishes the interest point better than simple brightness comparison tests that are 
present in BRISK0

BRISK0-SURF2D:
1. Might not be set at an optimal threshold, therefore doesnt detect many matches


BRISK4:

1. Performs a non-maximal suppression along scale space which results in less interest points being detected
2. But more interest points may be detected as there are more octaves and therefore more ways to test interest points

3. Since BRISK4 has such a strong non-maximal suppression  criterion, it detects a large number of zero matches. This causes
the ROC curve to have a lower value than the other ROC curves.
4. In addition, BRISK4 has a large number of valid matches (these are duplicate matches that are matched with the fluorescent lights)
There are many strong edges and therefore these will go through the BRISK4's non-maximal suppression criterion.

BRISK0:
1. BRISK0 has less matches since less interest points are detected and therefore less valid matches are realised. However, the strong edges
will still get through these valid matches

U-BRISK:
1. U-BRISK is rotation variant and therefore many matches are lost due to this constraint. This actually aids the algorithm in removing
duplicate matches.
2. UBRISK - Does not perform a rotation and therefore less matches may be found


U-BRISK Lighting:
1. Many interest points found around wires and near the main lights.
2. It is possible that stronger edges are created due to the main light being on near the wires and this causes the large number of interest
points to be detected



SURF2D:

1.SURF2D has fewer matches



 - Reflections cause invalid matches. Remember to use the reflections from the window in the Main Robocup dataset
