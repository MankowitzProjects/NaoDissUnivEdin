Call alcommon and install bhuman SDK

********************************************
OpenCV
********************************************
OpenCV is found on the nao SDK called naoqi-sdk-1.12.5-linux32.tar.gz in a folder called opencv.
Now we need to find out how to add new files to this SDK

1. It seems these packages are called using the alcommoninstall script from the nao-sdk
2. These packages are then installed into the ehuman framework into /Util/Alcommon/
3. It seems that these files are copied from the tar "naoqi-sdk-1.12.3-linux32.tar.gz" (Why not naoqi-sdk-1.10???)


********************************************
To uninstall opencv
********************************************

Thanks! Just what I was looking for. I uninstalled the packages, then ran sudo find / -name "opencv" -exec rm -i {} \; then reinstalled the packages. Fixed my last error by running sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite path-to-package. OpenCV seems to work now, though I'm yet to test it thoroughly. Python-OpenCV is working like before. 

To uninstall opencv, you need to use the command "sudo make uninstall"

Note: An error may occur in ubuntu 11.04:
Something like "linux/videodev.h not found.
Solution: The library is not available and therefore the simplest solution if you dont need the library is to build the package without "WITH_V4l"


Note: GTK support refers to cvShowImage, cvWaitKey etc. This has to be disabled which means that various libraries cannot be called upon
Solution: However, hopefully, by installing my version of open cv onto the SDK, I will be able to use all the drawing functions etc...


I need to try and copy the relevant libray files into the usr/bin or usr/lib (probably lib) that are relevant to my building procedure on the Nao.
These lib files come from the opencv library

I can then just build my libraries exactly as before on my pc and then connect this to the Nao.

********************************************
Copying files to the Nao
********************************************
When copying files to the Nao, make sure to add build flags to the file Nao.cmake.zBuild. The flags are -msse2, -msse4.2
This will enable the relevant instruction sets


********************************************
Symbolic links do not work when the original library is moved to a new folder. Therefore, you need to recreate the links.
