1. I could use the ordering of features to remove some invalid matches.
Problem: is that if features are too close together and the image is rotated, then the features will be in a different order 
but they should still be matched correctly
2. It may be possible to find the Euclidean distance to each of the features. 
Problem: If there are invalid matches, then the Euclidean distance will be incorrect for all features
3. Try and transform the image in terms of rotation and scale in order to get it standard. Calculate the projection matrix using
the bank image and the actual image and see good the projection matrix is. If it seems good, then a good match has occurred. 
4. Maybe use response or size in order to detect valid features. Are two matching keypoints the same size/ have similar responses?

Problems:
1. The SSE2 and SSSE3 instruction sets are not enabled. 
Solution: Add the command -msse2 and -msse4.2 to the relevant buildfiles in the Nao. These are Nao.make.zbuild etc...
Note: -msse3 and -msse4.2 should be added to SimulatedNao.zbuild makefile
