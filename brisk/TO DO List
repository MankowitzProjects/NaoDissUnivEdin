TO DO:

1. Add the method for detecting invalid features based on the ordering constraint. **
2. Incorporate OpenSurf into the code (Removing the dependance on OpenCV from SURF descriptor's perspective. **
3. Test BRISK BRISK - Sent email, awaiting reply
4. Compare times, accuracy for SURF, BRISK, SIFT etc.
5. Look at reducing the run-time of the code, by modifying SURF descriptor.
6. Try and compile the code on the Nao **
7. Adapt the formula in determining the optimal radius and threshold to take weights into account. **
8. Look at Benji's idea of invariant scale and rotation.

//Tests to perform
1. Once the new weighting formula has been found, re-run the matching tests.
2. Create a test to find the difference in size between each of the keypoints
3. Create a test to find the length (xdist, ydist and euclidean) between each of the keypoints
